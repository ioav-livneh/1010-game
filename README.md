# Background

This project is a web version of the mobile app with the same name. I developed this game during my time at Ironhack bootcamp in Amsterdam in 2019. Using jQuery, I created the initial version in just one week. The project consists of one HTML file, one CSS file, and one JavaScript file. I've made many improvements since then and plan to add more features in the future.

## Instructions

1. Click one of the three randomly generated shapes below.
1. Place it onto the board.
1. Complete a row or column of 10 to clear more space.
1. To return a piece, click back on its original spot.
1. Aim for the highest score.
1. The game ends when you have no more room to place shapes.
