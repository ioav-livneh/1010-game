# 1010!

    This website was built with HTML, CSS, JS (jQuery). This project is a web clone of the mobile app by the same name. I originally built it at the Ironhack bootcamp in 2019.

## Instructions

    Click one of the three randomly generated shapes below and place it onto the board. Complete a row or column of 10 to clear out more space. If you change your mind after clicking one piece, you can return it by clicking back at the spot where you took it from. The goal is to get the highest score. You lose when you run out of moves (run out of room to place your shapes)
